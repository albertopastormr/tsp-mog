# TSP - MOG

In this repository we store every documentation file including code files that we have used to introduce our classmates to the Travelling Salesman Problem as an optional special assignment for a subject called *Operational Models of Management*(originally, MOG).

You can directly jump to the [slides](slides.pdf) or read the [full documentation](tsp.pdf) that the slides are based on. Both have been written in spanish  because of a language constraint in the assignment for the subject

## Travelling Salesman Problem üèô

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"

## Implementation üíª

We have implemented two solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem using [C++(branch and bound)](branch-bound.cpp) and [Python(nearest neighbour)](tsp.py)
